# Driveway Coding Conventions Doc

## Project Structure
For every controller that is unique to the feature you're working on, place the controllers to the corresponding folders.
i.e:
  Seller Edit for the Selling Tab (controller should be placed in Spotter/Controllers/Selling)
  
For everything else that is shared, just place it in Controllers.

For bridging files and the like, place it under Spotter/Supporting Libraries

## Coding Convention
For classes, PascalCase
For variable names, camelCase
